# Contributing

Thanks for openning this file!

All levels are welcome to engage with me and contribute to this project.

You can open an issue or engage on X ([https://x.com/nohokthen](https://x.com/nohokthen)).

## Pre-requisites

In order to develop new fetures you will need:

- Go installed
- Docker (to run the dev environment and integration tests), without the need of sudo to run it
- A postgres db running locally or in the cloud (try AWS, Neon, they have free tiers)
- An app in one of the providers in order to test auth

## Commands

I will not go over build, fmt, vet, test, since they are pretty obvious.

The commands for development are:

```
# To  start the dev environemnet
make start

# It will launch the mock project inside of /dev, that is using the local Aegis for auth
# You can access this website at localhost:5000

# Kill it
make kill
```

# For development
