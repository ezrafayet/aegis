# Pre-requisites

In order to run the project locally you need:
- Go (quite obviously)
- Docker (to run the dev environment and integration tests)
- A Postgres db running locally or in the cloud
- An app in one of the providers in order to test auth (GitHub is easy)

## Commands

Check the comprehensive list of commands in Makefile.

Run them with:

```
make command
```

# The development environment

I have added a development environment to make it easy to test authentication.

Is it perfect or finished ? No, but it is pretty cool.

Run it with:

```
make start
```

It runs Aegis as a service and the service under /dev that uses it. Note you will need a config.json in src for it to run.

A classic config.json:

```json

    "name": "Aegis",

# Advices

- Check the behavior of the API in the [integration tests](https://github.com/ezrafayet/aegis/blob/master/src/integration/integration_test.go)
- Run the dev mode
- Write something simple first to get to know how it works (example: add a provider)

# How to publish a new version on Docker Hub

```
sudo docker build -t ezrafayet/aegis:v0.3.0 .
sudo docker push ezrafayet/aegis:v0.3.0
```
